### GitHub

Links to most of my software packages and code repositories are also available via [GitHub](https://github.com/lmweber).

Key packages and repositories are listed below. Additional smaller repositories are also available via [GitHub](https://github.com/lmweber).



### Software packages

- **diffcyt**: R package implementing a computational framework for differential discovery analyses in high-dimensional cytometry data. [Available from Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/diffcyt).

- **HDCytoData**: R package providing streamlined access to a number of publicly available high-dimensional cytometry benchmark datasets in standard Bioconductor object formats. [Available from Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData).

- **regsplice**: R package implementing statistical methodology for detection of differential splicing (differential exon usage) in RNA-seq data. [Available from Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/regsplice).



### Code repositories

- [**snp-dmx-cancer**](https://github.com/lmweber/snp-dmx-cancer): Snakemake pipeline and code repository to reproduce analyses in our paper evaluating genetic variation-based demultiplexing for single-cell RNA sequencing ([Weber et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.371963v1)).

- [**diffcyt-evaluations**](https://github.com/lmweber/diffcyt-evaluations): GitHub repository containing code to reproduce the benchmarking analyses in our paper introducing the *diffcyt* framework ([Weber et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0415-5)).

- [**cytometry-clustering-comparison**](https://github.com/lmweber/cytometry-clustering-comparison): GitHub repository containing reproducible code from our benchmark paper comparing clustering algorithms for high-dimensional cytometry data ([Weber and Robinson, 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.23030)).



### Data repositories

- [**FlowRepository FR-FCM-ZYL8**](http://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-ZYL8): Data repository containing datasets used in the benchmarking analyses from our paper introducing the *diffcyt* framework ([Weber et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0415-5)). These datasets are also provided in a more easily accessible format in the [HDCytoData](http://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData) Bioconductor package.

- [**FlowRepository FR-FCM-ZZPH**](http://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-ZZPH): Data repository containing benchmark datasets from our paper comparing clustering algorithms for high-dimensional cytometry data ([Weber and Robinson, 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.23030)). These datasets are also provided in a more easily accessible format in the [HDCytoData](http://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData) Bioconductor package.
