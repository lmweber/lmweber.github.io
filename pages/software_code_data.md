title: Software, code, data
---


I have led the development of and am responsible for maintaining several software packages, available as R packages from Bioconductor and GitHub. In addition, I have created publicly accessible code and data repositories to support the analyses in my published papers.

Key software, code, and data resources are listed below. Additional projects are also accessible from my [GitHub](https://github.com/lmweber) page.



### Software packages

Development versions of these packages are also available from [GitHub](https://github.com/lmweber).

- **diffcyt**: R package implementing a computational framework for differential discovery analyses in high-dimensional cytometry data. [Available from Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/diffcyt).

- **HDCytoData**: R package providing streamlined access to a number of publicly available high-dimensional cytometry benchmark datasets in standard Bioconductor object formats. [Available from Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData).

- **regsplice**: R package implementing statistical methodology for detection of differential splicing (differential exon usage) in RNA-seq data. [Available from Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/regsplice).



### Code repositories

Additional code repositories (e.g. smaller projects, examples and tutorials, and ongoing projects) are available from my [GitHub](https://github.com/lmweber) page. Papers corresponding to the repositories below are also listed on the [Publications](pages/publications.html) page.

- [**diffcyt-evaluations**](https://github.com/lmweber/diffcyt-evaluations): GitHub repository containing code to reproduce the benchmarking analyses in our paper introducing the *diffcyt* framework ([Weber et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0415-5)).

- [**cytometry-clustering-comparison**](https://github.com/lmweber/cytometry-clustering-comparison): GitHub repository containing reproducible code from our paper comparing clustering algorithms for high-dimensional cytometry data ([Weber and Robinson, 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.23030)).



### Data repositories

Papers corresponding to the repositories below are also listed on the [Publications](pages/publications.html) page.

- [**FlowRepository FR-FCM-ZYL8**](http://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-ZYL8): Data repository containing datasets used in the benchmarking analyses from our paper introducing the *diffcyt* framework ([Weber et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0415-5)). These datasets are also provided in a more easily accessible format in the [HDCytoData](http://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData) Bioconductor package.

- [**FlowRepository FR-FCM-ZZPH**](http://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-ZZPH): Data repository containing benchmark datasets from our paper comparing clustering algorithms for high-dimensional cytometry data ([Weber and Robinson, 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.23030)). These datasets are also provided in a more easily accessible format in the [HDCytoData](http://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData) Bioconductor package.
