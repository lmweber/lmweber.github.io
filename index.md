### About

I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/) at [Boston University School of Public Health](https://www.bu.edu/sph/), starting Oct 2023. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher funded by a [K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/5u7x8jpqxUSznDKcHnIqSw/project-details/10350850) from [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/), advised by [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/).

My research work is in statistical genomics and biomedical data science on the development of statistical methodology, software, and collaborative analyses for data from high-throughput genomic technologies applied to biological questions in neuroscience and cancer biology. Currently, I am especially focused on data from spatially-resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing platforms. I implement statistical methods as R packages within the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project.

I support open science principles, including the release of freely accessible open-source software, reproducible analyses, code and data resources, and publication of preprints. During methodological work, I emphasize rigorous benchmarking against existing and baseline methods. I enjoy teaching, and have been an instructor for several short workshops on R programming and data science skills through the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) initiatives. In January 2021, I received a [Research Symbiont award](https://researchsymbionts.org/) in recognition of my efforts in sharing code and data resources.

My training includes a PhD in Biostatistics advised by [Dr. Mark Robinson](https://robinsonlabuzh.github.io/) at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and a MSc in Statistics at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Previously, I studied physics, mathematics, and economics at the University of Western Australia and Australian National University, and worked as a policy analyst for the Australian federal public service.
