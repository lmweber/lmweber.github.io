### About

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Prof. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) at the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), [Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I am working on data analysis, statistical methodology, and software development for single-cell data.

I am interested in rigorous development and benchmarking of statistical and computational methodologies, with applications in high-throughput biological data, especially single-cell genomic and proteomic data. Most of my work uses the R programming language, and I develop software packages for the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project. I am strongly committed to open science, including publication of preprints and open access publications, as well as freely accessible software, code, and data repositories.

I am also interested in teaching, especially R programming skills, and have been an instructor for several short workshops taught through the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) initiatives.

My training includes a PhD in Biostatistics with [Prof. Mark Robinson](https://robinsonlabuzh.github.io/) at the University of Zurich, Switzerland; and a MSc in Statistics at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Previously, I studied physics, mathematics, and economics at the University of Western Australia and Australian National University, and worked for several years as a policy analyst for the Australian federal public service.
