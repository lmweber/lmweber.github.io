### About

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/) at [Boston University School of Public Health](https://www.bu.edu/sph/).

My research is in statistical genomics and biomedical data science on the development of statistical methodology, open-source software, and collaborative analyses for data from high-throughput genomic technologies, applied to biological questions in neuroscience and cancer biology. Currently, I am especially focused on data from spatially-resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing platforms. I implement statistical methods as R packages within the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project.

I support open science principles, including the release of freely accessible open-source software, reproducible analyses, code and data resources, and publication of preprints. During methodological work, I emphasize rigorous benchmarking against existing and baseline methods. I enjoy teaching, and have been an instructor for several short workshops on R programming and data science skills through the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) initiatives.

My training includes a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and a MSc in Statistics at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
