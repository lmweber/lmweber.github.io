### About

I am a postdoctoral researcher funded by a [K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/5u7x8jpqxUSznDKcHnIqSw/project-details/10350850) from the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/), advised by [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/).

My work in on the development of unsupervised statistical methodology and software for analyzing data from spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and other high-throughput genomics technologies. I implement these methods as freely available R packages within the open-source [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project.

My methodological work is motivated by collaborative projects with experimental researchers in fields including neuroscience and cancer. I strongly support open science principles including the release of open-source software, reproducible analyses, free availability of code and data resources, and publication of preprints. I also support rigorous benchmarking against existing methods during development work. I enjoy teaching, and have been an instructor for several short workshops on R programming and data science skills through the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) initiatives. In January 2021, I received a [Research Symbiont award](https://researchsymbionts.org/) in recognition of my efforts in sharing open code and data resources.

My training includes a PhD in Biostatistics with [Dr. Mark Robinson](https://robinsonlabuzh.github.io/) at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and a MSc in Statistics at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Previously, I studied physics, mathematics, and economics at the University of Western Australia and Australian National University, and worked as a policy analyst for the Australian federal public service.
