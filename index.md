### About

I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Dr. Stephanie Hicks's](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) group in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/).

My work is on the development of statistical methodology and software for analyzing high-throughput genomics data, especially from spatially resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. My methodological work is motivated by collaborative projects in fields including neuroscience and cancer.

I support open science principles, including the release of open-source software, free availability of code and data resources, and publication of preprints. For methodological work, I support rigorous benchmarking against existing methods. Most of my work is in the R programming language, and I have developed several software packages for the open-source [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project. I also enjoy teaching, and have been an instructor for several [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshops. In January 2021, I received a [Research Symbiont award](https://researchsymbionts.org/) in recognition of my efforts in sharing open code and data resources.

My training includes a PhD in Biostatistics with [Dr. Mark Robinson](https://robinsonlabuzh.github.io/) at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and a MSc in Statistics at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Previously, I studied physics, mathematics, and economics at the University of Western Australia and Australian National University, and worked as a policy analyst for the Australian federal public service.
